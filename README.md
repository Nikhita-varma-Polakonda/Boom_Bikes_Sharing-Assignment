# Boom_Bikes_Sharing-Assignment

This assignment is focused on predicting bike-sharing demand using Linear Regression. The project was inspired by a real-world scenario where BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, is looking to improve their services and predict bike demand post-COVID-19 lockdown.
demand post-COVID-19 lockdown.

## ⚓Problem Overview:
BoomBikes faced a significant drop in revenue due to the ongoing pandemic and is now looking to understand the demand dynamics of shared bikes in the American market once the economy recovers. The goal of this analysis was to predict the demand for shared bikes based on various meteorological and socioeconomic factors, such as temperature, humidity, day of the week, season, and more.

## ⚓My Approach:
🏍Data Exploration: I began by analyzing the dataset, which included factors like weather conditions, time of year, and user patterns.

🏍Feature Engineering: Extracted key variables from the dataset that I believed were most relevant for predicting bike demand.

🏍Model Building: I applied Linear Regression to model the relationship between these variables and the demand for shared bikes.

🏍Evaluation: Assessed model performance using R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate the prediction accuracy. 

## ⚓Key Takeaways:
🏍Feature Importance: It’s crucial to understand which factors impact the demand the most (e.g., weather, time of year).

🏍Predictive Modeling: Linear regression is a useful tool for understanding linear relationships between variables, but it’s essential to continuously improve models by incorporating more complex algorithms.

🏍Business Implications: This model can provide valuable insights for BoomBikes to adjust pricing, availability, and marketing strategies in anticipation of changes in demand.
